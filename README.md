# Car Price Prediction

Predict the price of used cars using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for building a predictive model to estimate car prices based on features such as make, model, year, mileage, and other relevant attributes. The goal is to help buyers and sellers make informed decisions using data-driven insights.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Prediction API or script
- Jupyter notebooks for experiments and visualization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or above
- pip (Python package manager)
- Recommended: virtualenv for isolated environments

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/alokr15/Car-Price-Prediction.git
    cd Car-Price-Prediction
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Download or prepare the dataset**
    - Place your dataset (CSV file) in the `data/` directory.
    - Update paths in scripts if necessary.

### Usage

You can run the main scripts or use the Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step exploration:

- **Train a model**
    ```bash
    python train.py --data data/cars.csv
    ```

- **Predict car prices**
    ```bash
    python predict.py --input examples/input.json
    ```

- **Explore notebooks**
    - Open `notebooks/EDA.ipynb` and `notebooks/Modeling.ipynb` for interactive exploration.
